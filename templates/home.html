            Play LAN PVP mode allows you to play rock paper scissors over a local area
            network with a friend if you don't like them enough to be in the same room
            as them. Just run the webserver, connect from different machines and select
            you player from the dropdown. I don't think this really works but try it
            anyway. I am actively looking for beta testers.

            Play RPS against a computer! If you don't have any friends, you can play
            against the computer where you chance of winning comes down to wits,
            strategy, cunning and luck! <sup>actual formula: chance_of_winning = ((wits +
                strategy + cunning) * 0) + luck
            </sup>
